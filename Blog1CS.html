  <h1> Blog 1: Pragmatic Programmer Chapter 1</h1>
  
  <body>
        <p>   In <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, the section which spoke to me the most 
      within the first chapter would be the section entitled Your Knowledge Portfolio. This section begins with a 
      quote from Benjamin Franklin which states "An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest". This is 
      my main reasoning for pursuing a college degree, so when I saw this it sparked my interest. It goes on to compare
      the knowledge which programmers maintain in regards to application domains, experience, programming languages, and 
      computing to the task of managing a financial portfolio. I understand the intense requirements for maintaining one of these,
      since I manage my own. Previously, I saw no connection between these two, and just thought that I needed to learn a 
      programming language to keep up with the job at hand. Now I can see that keeping up not only with programming languages,
      but also with emerging technology, will improve my image to potential employers. The image of learning an emerging technology
      to a high risk stock specifically spoke to me, since the effort required to do this is similar to the risk of investing money
      on high risk opportunities.
